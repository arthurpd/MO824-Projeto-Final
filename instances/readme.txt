The .txt files contain 180 instances for the two-dimensional Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (2L-CVRP). They are in the form:

---------------------------------------------
Instance: ***
Class: ***
   *** --- number of customers (no depot)
   *** --- number of vehicles
   *** --- number of items
Capacity - height - width of vehicles
   ***    ***    ***
Node - x - y - demand
  0    ***    ***    ***
  1    ***    ***    ***
 ...
Node - number of items - h - w for each item
  0    0
  1    ***    ***    ***    ***    ***
 ...
---------------------------------------------

where "***" represent the values to be read.
"Instance" gives the name of the original CVRP instance used for obtaining the complete graph and the weights. For the notation we used We refer to: P. Toth and D. Vigo. The Vehicle Routing Problem. SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, Philadelphia, 2002. Some instances may be modified in the numbering of the nodes, in order to have always the depot as node 0. "Class" gives the value of the class used for the random generation of the items for each customer.
